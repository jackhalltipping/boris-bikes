#Boris Bikes in London :bike:
## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to create a simple system to support [Boris Bikes in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santander_Cycles). The system will allow members of the public to remove and return bikes from docking stations, subject to their availability. On occassion, the bikes will break, and then they will be unavailable for rental. There will be a garage able to fix the broken bikes and a van service to facilitate the transport of broken bikes to the garage and return fixed bikes back to the docking stations. 

The docking stations, van and garage all have a maximum capacity to be specified by the customer.

## User Stories

In order to start developing the system the following [Users Stories](User-Stories.md) are evaluated, aiding the construction of the functions the customer requires. 

## TDD, OOD and Paired Programming
The system will be designed using Test Driven and Object Orientated Design, working under paired programming throughout.
